# Linter
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
When the user runs the js file in linter it checks for the missing semicolon in the code.
If there is missing semicolon at where it needs to be, it prints out the error message
that tells at what line number a semicolon is missing. If there is missing semicolon at 
line 3, it displays the error message like this: 
#### 'Line 3: Missing semicolon.'
